# Member Portal & Membership Page

A member-facing portal at `/member/` with a sustaining membership page as the first route. The membership page explains what sustaining membership is, shows benefits and community impact stats, and lets members create, modify, or cancel their subscription. Active members see a dashboard with their credit balance, contribution details, and a link to the Stripe Customer Portal.

No new domain models. This feature is a UI layer over the existing `subscription-service`, `credit-service`, and `credit_transaction` ledger.

## Route structure

```
src/routes/member/
├── +layout.server.ts       ← auth gate: redirect to /demo/login if no user
├── +layout.svelte          ← sidebar + topbar (mirrors staff layout)
└── membership/
    ├── +page.server.ts     ← load function + form actions
    └── +page.svelte        ← membership page
```

The member layout follows the staff layout pattern: check `event.locals.user`, redirect if missing. No role check — any authenticated user can access `/member/`. The sidebar starts with a single "Membership" item and is extensible for future pages.

---

## Page data

The load function in `+page.server.ts` returns:

```typescript
interface MembershipPageData {
	subscription: SubscriptionInfo | null;
	credits: Credits;
	billingPortalUrl: string | null;
	communityStats: {
		sustainingMemberCount: number;
		totalFreeHoursAllocated: number;
		participationPercent: number;
	};
}
```

### Subscription

From `getSubscription(user.stripeId)`. Returns null when no active subscription exists.

### Credits

From `getAllBalances(user.id)`. Returns `{ free_hours, equipment_credits }`.

### Billing portal URL

Generated at load time via `stripe.billingPortal.sessions.create()` with `return_url` pointing back to `/member/membership`. Only generated when `user.stripeId` is set; null otherwise. Portal sessions are valid for a few hours, which is fine for page load.

### Community stats

Cached in-memory with a 24-hour TTL. These are approximate vanity stats — freshness doesn't matter, just ballpark accuracy.

A module-level `getCommunityStats()` function in `src/lib/server/finance/community-stats.ts` holds the cached value and its expiry timestamp. On first call (or after expiry), it runs the queries and caches the result. All page loads within the TTL window share the same cached value.

```typescript
let cached: { stats: CommunityStats; expiresAt: number } | null = null;
const TTL_MS = 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000; // 24 hours

export async function getCommunityStats(): Promise<CommunityStats> {
	if (cached && Date.now() < cached.expiresAt) return cached.stats;
	const stats = await queryStats();
	cached = { stats, expiresAt: Date.now() + TTL_MS };
	return stats;
}
```

The underlying queries:

- **sustainingMemberCount** — count of distinct users with a `credit_transaction` where `source = 'monthly_allocation'` and `created_at` is within the current month. This counts users who received an allocation this billing cycle, which is a reliable proxy for "active sustaining member" without querying Stripe.

- **totalFreeHoursAllocated** — sum of `amount` from `credit_transaction` where `credit_type = 'free_hours'` and `source = 'monthly_allocation'` and `created_at` is within the current month. This is the total hours allocated this month across all sustaining members.

- **participationPercent** — `sustainingMemberCount / totalActiveUsers * 100`, where `totalActiveUsers` is the count of users where `deletedAt` is null.

These queries hit the `credit_transaction` table (indexed on `user_id` and `user_id, credit_type`) with a `created_at` filter. They run at most once per day.

---

## Form actions

Four form actions on the page server, all requiring an authenticated user with a `stripeId`:

### createSubscription

Creates a new subscription checkout session and redirects to Stripe.

```
Input:  { quantity: number, coverFees: boolean }
Guard:  quantity >= 2 (minimum $10/month at $5/unit)
Action: createCheckoutSession({ userId, stripeCustomerId, quantity, coverFees, successUrl, cancelUrl })
Result: redirect(303, checkoutUrl)
```

`successUrl` and `cancelUrl` both point to `/member/membership`.

### updateAmount

Modifies the contribution quantity on an existing subscription.

```
Input:  { quantity: number, coverFees: boolean }
Guard:  quantity >= 2
Action: updateQuantity(stripeCustomerId, quantity, coverFees)
Result: return { success: true } (page reloads via invalidation)
```

### resumeSubscription

Reverses a pending cancellation.

```
Input:  (none)
Guard:  subscription exists with cancelAtPeriodEnd === true
Action: resume(stripeCustomerId)
Result: return { success: true }
```

### cancel is handled by the Stripe Customer Portal

Members cancel through the portal link rather than a custom form action. The portal handles the confirmation UI and sets `cancel_at_period_end`. Our `customer.subscription.deleted` webhook handles the downstream credit reset.

## Page states

The page has three visual modes based on subscription status:

### 1. Non-member (no subscription)

Full marketing page. Sections in order:

1. **Hero** — headline, subtext, "Become a Sustaining Member" CTA button
2. **Benefits grid** — three-column layout (Practice Space, Equipment, Community)
3. **Sliding scale** — explains $5 = 1 hour, shows tier examples, "why sliding scale" callout
4. **Community impact** — three stat counters
5. **FAQ** — collapsible questions
6. **Bottom CTA** — repeat of the sign-up prompt with member count social proof

### 2. Cancelled-but-active (subscription with `cancelAtPeriodEnd: true`)

Banner at the top showing:

- "Your benefits continue until [currentPeriodEnd date]"
- Resume button + Manage Billing link
- Current contribution amount and remaining hours

Below the banner, the same marketing content as non-member (to remind them what they'll lose).

### 3. Active sustaining member

Dashboard view. Sections in order:

1. **Hero** — thank-you message
2. **Contribution card** — current amount/month, fee coverage indicator, next billing date, inline modify form, Manage Billing link
3. **Credit balance card** — three stat boxes (Total Hours / Remaining / Used), refresh date, feature list (recurring reservations, priority booking)
4. **Benefits grid** — two-column (Equipment Access, Community Perks) — more compact than the non-member version since they already have the benefits
5. **Community impact** — same three stat counters

---

## Subscription form

Shared between the "create" and "modify" flows. Renders inline on the page (not a modal).

Fields:

- **Contribution amount** — input in dollars, minimum $10, step $5. Displays the equivalent free hours as the user types (`$X/month = Y free hours`). The form converts dollars to quantity units by dividing by 5 before submitting.
- **Cover processing fees** — checkbox. Shows the calculated fee amount when checked (from `calculateTotalWithFeeCoverage`). Copy: "Cover processing fees so the Collective receives 100% of your contribution"

For the "create" flow, the submit button says "Start Contributing" and triggers the `createSubscription` action. For the "modify" flow, the button says "Update Amount" and triggers `updateAmount`.

## Copy

### Hero (non-member)

**Headline:** Play More. Pay Less. Keep the Collective Going.

**Subtext:** Sustaining members chip in monthly and get free practice hours, gear perks, and half-price events. You set the amount — we keep the lights on and the amps warm.

### Hero (active member)

**Headline:** You're Part of What Makes This Work

**Subtext:** Your monthly contribution keeps the practice rooms open, the gear library stocked, and the community humming. Here's where things stand.

### Benefits grid (non-member — three columns)

**Practice Time**

For every $5 you put in each month, you get an hour of free practice time. Set up recurring reservations so your favorite slot is always waiting, and jump the line when last-minute openings pop up.

**Gear Library**

The Collective has a whole library of gear you can borrow. Sustaining members get free accessory rentals (cables, stands, the stuff you always forget), monthly equipment credits that match your contribution, and better rates on the bigger stuff.

**Shows & Community**

Half-price tickets to every Collective event and show, first dibs on workshops, and the satisfaction of knowing you're helping keep independent music going in Corvallis.

### Benefits grid (active member — two columns)

**Gear Library**

- Free accessory rentals — cables, stands, mic clips, all the essentials
- Monthly equipment credits that match your contribution
- Better rates on premium gear

**Shows & Community**

- Half-price tickets to every Collective event and show
- First dibs on workshops and special events
- You're directly keeping music happening in Corvallis

### Sliding scale

**Headline:** Pick What Works for You

**Subtext:** There's no wrong number here. Every dollar goes to the Collective, and every $5 earns you another hour of practice time.

**Tiers:**

| Amount    | Hours         |
| --------- | ------------- |
| $10/month | 2 free hours  |
| $25/month | 5 free hours  |
| $50/month | 10 free hours |
| $60/month | 12 free hours |

**"Why sliding scale?" callout:**

Music shouldn't be gated by budget. Every tier gets the same benefits — the only difference is how many practice hours you walk away with. Contribute what feels right.

**Footer note:** Change or cancel anytime. No commitments, no awkward conversations.

### Cancelled banner

**Text:** Your sustaining membership has been cancelled, but your benefits — including [N] free practice hours — are still active until **[date]**. You can pick it back up anytime before then.

### Community impact

**Headline:** What We're Building Together

**Stat labels:**

- **[N] Sustaining Members** — showing up for the Collective every month
- **[N] Free Hours** — of practice time funded this month
- **[N]% of Members** — chipping in to keep things running

### FAQ

Six collapsible items:

1. **How do free practice hours work?** — For every $5 you contribute, you get one free hour each month. They show up automatically when your billing cycle renews and refresh monthly. Heads up — unused hours don't roll over, so use them while you've got them.

2. **Can I change my contribution amount?** — Anytime. Adjust it right here on this page. The new amount kicks in at your next billing cycle, and your hours adjust to match.

3. **What happens if I cancel?** — Nothing dramatic. You keep all your benefits until the end of your current billing period. After that, you're still a member — you just book practice space at the standard rate. And you can always come back.

4. **Can I use my hours for band rehearsals?** — That's the idea. Solo practice, band rehearsals, recording sessions — if you're the one making the reservation, your hours are good for it.

5. **What are recurring reservations?** — A sustaining member perk. Set up a weekly reservation and the same slot books automatically. Especially handy if your band has a regular practice night.

6. **How do equipment credits work?** — They match your contribution dollar for dollar — $25/month gets you $25 in equipment credits. Use them on premium gear rentals. The smaller stuff (cables, stands, mic clips) is free for all sustaining members.

### Bottom CTA (non-member only)

**Headline:** Sounds Good?

**Text:** [N] members are already in. Your contribution — whatever the amount — keeps the spaces open, the gear available, and the music going.

**Button:** Become a Sustaining Member

**Footer:** Cancel anytime. Seriously.

## "Used this month" calculation

The credit balance card shows "Hours Used" this month. This is calculated as:

```
usedThisMonth = totalAllocatedThisMonth - currentBalance
```

Where `totalAllocatedThisMonth` comes from the most recent `credit_transaction` with `source = 'monthly_allocation'` and `credit_type = 'free_hours'` for this user (the `amount` field on that row is the monthly allocation). `currentBalance` is `credits.free_hours` from `getAllBalances()`.

This calculation is done in the load function, not in a component.

---

## Member layout

### Auth gate (`+layout.server.ts`)

```typescript
export const load: LayoutServerLoad = async (event) => {
	const user = event.locals.user;
	if (!user) redirect(302, '/demo/login');
	return { user };
};
```

No role check — any authenticated user can see the member portal.

### Layout component (`+layout.svelte`)

Mirrors the staff layout: daisyUI drawer with `Sidebar` and `Topbar` components. The sidebar nav items start with:

```typescript
const navItems = [{ href: '/member/membership', label: 'Membership', icon: starIcon }];
```

Reuses the existing `Sidebar`, `Topbar`, and `UserFooter` components from `$lib/components/staff/`. If those components have staff-specific assumptions (colors, titles), they should be parameterized. Otherwise they can be used directly.

## Deferred

- **Payment history page** — could show past invoices pulled from Stripe. For now, the Stripe Customer Portal covers this.
- **Equipment credits display** — the credit balance card focuses on free hours. Equipment credits are a future addition when the equipment module is built.
- **Notification on subscription events** — email confirmations for subscription create/cancel/resume. Deferred until the notification system is in place.
- **Additional member portal pages** — reservations dashboard, band management, profile settings. The member layout is built to support these but they're separate features.

## Open questions

None. The backend services are complete, the UI is a presentation layer, and the Stripe Customer Portal handles the complex billing management flows.
