/**
 * Regression test for the create-band modal dying after a client-side
 * navigation (JAVASCRIPT-SVELTEKIT-Q / -1A family).
 *
 * With `compilerOptions.experimental.async`, a top-level `await` in a page
 * script marks every later declaration as "blocked": the compiler moves their
 * initialization into a post-await continuation and wraps every template
 * expression that references them in an async block. On /member/bands,
 * `showCreateModal` was declared after `await getMemberBands()`, so the
 * create-band <Modal> and the header button's onclick were both gated on that
 * continuation. When a client-side navigation reached the page while the
 * member layout's own async work was still settling (e.g. right after login),
 * the Modal's async block never committed — the header "Create Act" button
 * rendered and its handler ran, but no dialog ever mounted. Timing-dependent:
 * reliably reproduced in headless Chromium, usually invisible in headed
 * browsers.
 *
 * The fix declares the modal state before the await (and NotificationBell got
 * the same treatment for its window click handler, which crashed with
 * "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'f')" when clicked before its
 * awaited query resolved — the Sentry Q/1A crash).
 *
 * This test intentionally navigates CLIENT-SIDE immediately after login (the
 * turbulent window) rather than with page.goto(), which full-loads the page
 * and never raced.
